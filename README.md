Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The Gaming Room is a client interested in expanding on their game "Draw It or Lose It". It was originally created for android systems, and now they wish to scale the project up by making it accessible to other platforms like Windows and Mac. The client also wants only one instance of the game to exist in memory at any given time.


What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  For this document, I believe that I did well with analyzing and evaluating the development requirements for this project. It involved digging into information about aspects like the server side, the client side, and development tools for the varying operating platforms. It was intriguing to learn about the various aspects of these operating platforms and how they shine in different ways from each other. I was able to deeply consider the requirements because of my fascination with the topic. 


What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  There were several parts that I found extremely beneficial, but foremost, I found that the recommendations and evaluation sections helped the most because it allowed me to see what tools and operating platforms were most suitable for pursuing a project like this. Aside from that, I found the domain model section to be immensely helpful because it allowed me to see how the code would be broken down. Having it both in words, and visually as a diagram helps me find a deeper understanding of how the code will be organized and developed throughout the project.


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  Even though I feel fine with the answers I provided, I feel that the evaluation section could be even better with details. Given more time for research, I would have liked to go more into depth and elaborate more on the benefits of my recommendations for the project. I also would have liked to explain how the other options are not as good as the one that I chose. 


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  The user had desired specifications for how the game should work, such as there being only 2 teams with a certain number of players, and each player and team has their own unique names. Additionally, knowing that the user only wants 1 instance of the game running at a time, I am able to consider these factors and choose the most appropriate setup for the code. In this case, it ended up being a singleton based set up because it aligns best with what the user desires specifically. Furthermore, considering the user wants to expand into other software platforms, it forces me to consider other factors like how to adapt in the safest and most secure way that will leave the user satisfied. 


How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

  When designing software, one of the most crucial factors is communication. I have to get a detailed idea of what the user wants to implement so that the user is satisfied, and also so that I am not overworking and implementing things that the user does not care about. Beyond communication, it is essential to plan ahead before starting to code. Using diagrams and pseudocode are key to giving a developer an idea of how to form the code before even beginning it, and it can be used as a guide to stay organized as the developer does code. Overall, research is necessary to know how the code would be best implemented across several platforms if that is what software applications require in the future.
